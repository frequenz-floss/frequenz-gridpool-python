"""Data model for market topology relations.

A relation links a gridpool, a microgrid and a market location, based on the
Assets API `MarketTopologyRelation`. It names at least two of the three, and its
participations say which market use cases it serves and over which periods. The
config also supports plain validity periods and delivery-area mappings without
a gridpool.

Ownership of an asset by an enterprise is deliberately left out: it is not a
topology link but an exclusive, time-varying property of the asset, and will be
modelled on the asset itself.
