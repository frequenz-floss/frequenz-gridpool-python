    """Load configs from up to three sources and merge them in layers.

    Combines up to three sources, listed here from lowest to highest
    precedence: a *default* config file layer, the Assets API, and an
    *override* config file layer.  Higher layers win on conflicts, while
    lower layers fill in anything the higher ones leave unset.  This lets
    callers pick a strategy by choosing which sources to pass, for example:

    - `default_files` + `assets_client`: files provide defaults that the
      Assets API overrides.
    - `assets_client` + `override_files`: the Assets API provides the base
      that files override.
    - all three: the Assets API sits between a default and an override file
      layer.

    The microgrid IDs fetched from the Assets API are `microgrid_ids` when
    given, otherwise the IDs found in the default and override files.  This
    lets the Assets API layer be used even when no files are given.

    Args:
        default_files:
            Optional path or list of paths to config files forming the
            lowest-precedence layer.
        assets_client:
            Optional Assets API client.  When given, microgrid metadata and
            formulas are fetched and layered above the default files.
        override_files:
            Optional path or list of paths to config files forming the
            highest-precedence layer.
        microgrid_ids:
            Optional explicit microgrid IDs to fetch from the Assets API.
            When given, these replace the IDs derived from the files, so the
            Assets API layer can be used without any files.
        component_graph_config:
            How to build the component graph and generate its formulas.  See
            `ComponentGraphConfig`.  Defaults to that class's own defaults.
            Requires an `assets_client`.

    Returns:
        The merged document. Use `.microgrids` for just the microgrid map; the
        file layers may also contribute `relations` and `market_locations`,
        which the Assets API layer does not provide.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If none of the three sources is provided, if `microgrid_ids`
            or `component_graph_config` is given without an `assets_client`, or
