        Later files take precedence, entry by entry, so a file can override
        single fields of an entry another defines. The raw tables are merged
        before they are loaded, so a field left unset in an override keeps the
        base value rather than being reset to its default. Paths that are not
        files are skipped with a warning.

        Args:
            config_files: A path or list of paths to TOML config files.
            check: Whether to run the whole-document `check`. It skips only that
                cross-entity pass; the schema and each entry's own validation
                still run. Pass all layers of a stack together rather than
                loading one incomplete override with `check=False`.
